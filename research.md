    <i> Abstract:</i>  I use generative artificial intelligence (AI) to forecast currency returns based on economic fundamentals and revisit the exchange rate disconnect puzzle first documented by Meese and Rogoff (1983). Using ChatGPT (and DeepSeek), I analyze a comprehensive dataset of economic data releases for major currency pairs and construct variables that capture the fundamental strength of each currency's economy. These AI-powered variables exhibit significant cross-sectional predictive power, as a simple trading strategy that goes long on currencies with strong AI-derived fundamentals and short on those with weak AI-derived fundamentals achieves an annualized Sharpe ratio exceeding 0.7. The excess returns of this strategy remain significant after controlling for traditional currency factors. Furthermore, to mitigate look‚Äêahead bias, I implement rigorous tests to ensure that AI's performance stems from reasoning rather than memorization. Finally, I explore the underlying sources of this predictability and find evidence suggesting that the Taylor rule framework, which central banks use to set interest rates, is a key mechanism connecting exchange rates to economic fundamentals.

  <div class="paper-abstract">
    <i>Description:</i> An open-source Python package implementing the Principal Portfolios framework of Kelly, Malamud &amp; Pedersen (2023, <em>The Journal of Finance</em>). It combines own-asset and cross-asset predictive signals to build optimal trading strategies. Install with:
    <code>pip install principal_portfolios</code>. See the <code>examples/</code> folder for a fully worked notebook that reproduces all results from Kelly et al. (2023).
