     <div class="paper-abstract">
    I use generative artificial intelligence (AI) to forecast currency returns based on economic fundamentals and revisit the exchange rate disconnect puzzle first documented by Meese and Rogoff (1983). Using ChatGPT (and DeepSeek), I analyze a comprehensive dataset of economic data releases for major currency pairs and construct variables that capture the fundamental strength of each currency's economy. These AI-powered variables exhibit significant cross-sectional predictive power, as a simple trading strategy that goes long on currencies with strong AI-derived fundamentals and short on those with weak AI-derived fundamentals achieves an annualized Sharpe ratio exceeding 0.7. The excess returns of this strategy remain significant after controlling for traditional currency factors. Furthermore, to mitigate look‐ahead bias, I implement rigorous tests to ensure that AI's performance stems from reasoning rather than memorization. Finally, I explore the underlying sources of this predictability and find evidence suggesting that the Taylor rule framework, which central banks use to set interest rates, is a key mechanism connecting exchange rates to economic fundamentals.
