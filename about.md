    Amin Izadyar is a doctoral researcher in finance at Imperial College London. His research lies at the intersection of empirical asset pricing, machine learning, and applied AI. He earned his Master of Research degree with Distinction and was awarded the Imperial College President’s PhD Scholarship in recognition of his excellent academic performance. Before joining Imperial, he completed an MBA and a BSc in Electrical Engineering—both with first-class honours—at Sharif University of Technology. <div style="margin-top: 0.6em;"></div>
    Amin’s recent research focuses on currency return predictability using AI, cross-asset predictive signals in global portfolios, and robust methods for estimating factor structures in the foreign exchange market. This work builds on his strong quantitative foundation, demonstrated by a perfect GRE score (340/340) and exceptional performance in national university entrance exams, ranking 2nd out of 20,000 for his master’s and 9th out of 150,000 for his bachelor’s. <div style="margin-top: 0.6em;"></div>
